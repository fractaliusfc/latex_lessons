You will \textbf{rejoice} to hear that no \emph{disaster} has accompanied the
commencement of an \textit{enterprise} which you have regarded with \textbf{\emph{such} \textit{evil}
forebodings}.  \textbf{I} arrived here yesterday, and \textit{my first task is to assure
my dear \textbf{sister} of my welfare and increasing \emph{confidence in} the success}
of my undertaking.


\underline{How slowly} the time passes here, \textbf{encompassed} as I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  
I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom 
I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
